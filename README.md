It seems not to be possible to build a klc for the Cyrillic keyboard as it is, since it forces an excess of the number of OEM mappings allowed by Windows. I will probably build a Keyman version of it at some point as a substitute. However, you can still build a klc for the Latin keyboard with Kalamine if you change the locale + variant to existing ones, such as "mn custom".
